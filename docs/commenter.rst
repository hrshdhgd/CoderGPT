Commenter Module
================

This module contains the CodeCommenter class, which is designed to enhance code readability by automatically adding comments and Sphinx-compatible docstrings to a given piece of code.

Classes
-------

CodeCommenter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. autoclass:: CodeCommenter
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

   The CodeCommenter class leverages a runnable chain to analyze code and generate explanatory comments and docstrings.

   .. automethod:: __init__
   .. automethod:: comment

Methods
-------

__init__(self, chain)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initializes the CodeCommenter class with a specified runnable chain.

:parameter chain: A ``RunnableSerializable`` object that is capable of executing defined tasks. This chain is responsible for the primary operation of analyzing and generating comments for the provided code.
:type chain: RunnableSerializable[Dict, Any]

comment(self, code, filename, overwrite=False, language=None)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generates comments for the given code and writes the commented code to a file.

:parameter code: The code for which comments are to be generated. This should be a string containing the source code.
:type code: str

:parameter filename: The name of the original file from which the code was extracted. This filename is used to generate a new filename for the commented code unless ``overwrite`` is set to True.
:type filename: str

:parameter overwrite: Determines whether the original file should be overwritten with the commented code. By default, this is set to False, and the commented code is written to a new file with an "_updated" suffix.
:type overwrite: bool, optional

:parameter language: The programming language of the code. This is an optional parameter that can be used to specify the language if it cannot be inferred from the code or filename. Providing this information can help the runnable chain to generate more accurate and language-appropriate comments.
:type language: Optional[str], optional

This method first invokes the runnable chain with the provided code and an instruction to add comments and Sphinx-compatible docstrings in a specific format. The response from the chain is expected to contain the commented code, which is then written to either a new file or the original file based on the ``overwrite`` parameter.

Dependencies
------------

- os: Used for file path manipulation and generating new filenames.
- typing: Provides support for type hints.
