Explainer Module
================

.. autoclass:: CodeExplainer
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

   The ``CodeExplainer`` class is designed to extract and explain code from a given file. It utilizes a runnable chain to process and interpret the code, providing explanations for specific functions, classes, or the entire codebase.

   Initialization
   --------------

   .. automethod:: __init__

      :param chain: A ``RunnableSerializable`` object that is capable of executing tasks. This is essential for the ``CodeExplainer`` class as it relies on this chain to process and explain the code.

   Explanation Method
   ------------------

   .. automethod:: explain

      This method is responsible for explaining the contents of the code. It can target specific functions, classes, or the entire code base depending on the parameters provided.

      :param code: The actual code that you want to be explained. This should be a string containing the code snippet or file contents.
      :param function: (Optional) The name of the function within the code that you specifically want explained. If not provided, the explainer may focus on the entire code or specified class.
      :param classname: (Optional) The name of the class within the code that you specifically want explained. If not provided, the explainer may focus on the entire code or a specified function.
      :param language: (Optional) The programming language of the code. Providing this information can help tailor the explanation process to the specific syntax and semantics of the language.

      The method invokes the runnable chain with the code (and optionally, the specific function or class) to be explained. It then pretty prints the explanation returned by the chain.
