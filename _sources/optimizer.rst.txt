Optimizer Module
================

.. module:: optimizer
   :synopsis: Module containing the CodeOptimizer class for optimizing code files.

.. moduleauthor:: Your Name

Classes
-------

.. autoclass:: CodeOptimizer
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

   The CodeOptimizer class is responsible for optimizing, commenting, and adding Sphinx-style docstrings to code within a given file. It leverages a provided runnable chain capable of executing tasks to perform the optimization.

   .. automethod:: __init__

   .. automethod:: optimize

``CodeOptimizer``
-----------------

.. py:class:: CodeOptimizer(chain)

   Initializes the CodeOptimizer class with a runnable chain for executing optimization tasks.

   :param chain: A RunnableSerializable object capable of executing tasks. This chain is invoked to perform code optimization, commenting, and documentation.

.. py:method:: optimize(filename, function=None, classname=None, overwrite=False)

   Optimizes the code within the specified file. This method reads the source code, invokes the optimization chain, and writes the optimized code either to the same file or to a new file with an "_updated" suffix based on the ``overwrite`` flag.

   :param str filename: The path to the code file to be optimized. This is the file from which the source code will be read.
   :param str function: (Optional) The name of the function within the file to specifically optimize. If provided, only this function will be targeted for optimization. Default is None.
   :param str classname: (Optional) The name of the class within the file to specifically optimize. If provided, only this class will be targeted for optimization. Default is None.
   :param bool overwrite: If True, the original file will be overwritten with the optimized code. Otherwise, a new file with the "_updated" suffix will be created to hold the optimized code. Default is False.

   **Example Usage**:

   .. code-block:: python

      from langchain_core.runnables.base import RunnableSerializable
      from optimizer import CodeOptimizer

      # Assuming 'chain' is an instance of RunnableSerializable
      optimizer = CodeOptimizer(chain)
      optimizer.optimize("example.py", overwrite=True)
